#  Customer Churn Analysis – Telco Dataset

This project analyzes customer behavior data from a telecom company to discover patterns leading to churn (i.e., when a customer leaves the service).  
It includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory analysis**, **statistical interpretation**, and **visual storytelling** – all aimed to inform business and model-building decisions.
